## APIs

#### Intrinio
- over 300 feeds
- pay for only the data you want and choose a pricing tier to fit your specific needs
- they also cater exceptionally to developers and students
- 30-day trial - 100 calls/second

#### Alpha Vantage
- free
- 5 requests per minute
- $19.99/month for 15 requests per minute, $249.99/month for 600 requests per minute.
- up to 20 years of historical data

#### Quandl
- subscribe to the feeds you want
- 300 calls per 10 seconds, 2,000 calls per 10 minutes, and 50,000 calls per day (a free tier)
- $29.00/month for a single developer (720,000 calls per day and more accurate, reliable data)
- does not offer a free trial for their US Stock Prices feed
- a bit harder to read than the key/value structure Intrinio and Alpha Vantage return

#### Xignite
- free trial only lasts 7 days (small number of calls)
- they don’t offer a month-to-month payment option, so you have to commit to a full year of API access

#### IEX
- based out of NYC
- free and doesn’t require users to make an account
- 100 calls per second
- a few years of data 
- only covers IEX :(
